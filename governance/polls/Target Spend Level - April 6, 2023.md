# Poll: Target Spend Level - April 6, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 22 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.**
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.**
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following target spending amounts for the next 6 months, as dictated in the [Signal Request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-n6m-target-spend-level/17122#signal-request-poll-8):
* **Abstain** - Voters should rank Abstain as their only option if they support any outcome determined by other MKR voters.
* **No change** - Voters should rank this option in order of preference if they support offering no additional guidance to the DAO on spending targets.
* **15 million DAI** - Voters should rank this option in order of preference if they would like to see the DAO target a spending level of 15M DAI over the next 6 months.
* **15.5 million DAI**  - Voters should rank this option in order of preference if they would like to see the DAO target a spending level of 15.5M DAI over the next 6 months.
* **16 million DAI**  - Voters should rank this option in order of preference if they would like to see the DAO target a spending level of 16M DAI over the next 6 months.
* **16.5 million DAI**  - Voters should rank this option in order of preference if they would like to see the DAO target a spending level of 16.5M DAI over the next 6 months.
* **17 million DAI**  - Voters should rank this option in order of preference if they would like to see the DAO target a spending level of 17M DAI over the next 6 months.
