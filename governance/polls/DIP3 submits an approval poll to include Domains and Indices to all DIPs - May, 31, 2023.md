# Poll: DIP3 submits an approval poll to include Domains and Indices to all DIPs - May 31, 2023

Dijets Core Team acting as interim Governance Arbiter have placed an approval poll into Dijets Voting System for proposing the addition of a further classification of the Domains and Indices into the preamble of the DIPs. This Governance Poll will be active for seven days beginning on Wednesday, May 31 at 16:00 UTC. Note that the DGC Members do not require a CAP before voting on this approval poll.

Procuring a CAP will be mandatory for DGC members before each governance cycle begins. CAPs and the Governance Cycle will come into effect as soon as the program has had the required core personnel onboarded and it has had some time to mature.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **Members may vote for a single option.**
- **Members should vote for the option they prefer.**
- **Members can choose to 'Abstain' should they not have any preference or if they prefer either options.**

## Review

Dijets Council may vote in this approval poll to express support or opposition to DIP3 being accepted and implemented in Dijets Governance.

A brief summary of this proposal is as follows:

*DIP3 submits an approval poll to include Domains and Indices to all DIPs.*

facilitates a structured and organised approach to formulating DIPs that are precise in addressing specific problems, and concise with exploring opportunities within the respective domains. It ensures that no aspect of the ecosystem is overlooked and provides a systematic framework for collaboration and coordination between the council and the organisation personnel. By dividing the entire Dijets ecosystem into core units with individual domains, the overall process for DIPs becomes more manageable and conducive to effective implementation.
